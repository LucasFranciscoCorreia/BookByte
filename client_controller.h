 * This function presents a menu to the user with options to list clients, search for a client,
 * add a new client, edit an existing client, or go back to the previous menu. The user's choice
 * is read and the corresponding function is called to perform the selected operation.
 *
 * The menu options are:
 * 1. List - Calls the ListClients() function to display a list of clients.
 * 2. Search - Calls the SearchClientMenu() function to search for a client.
 * 3. Add - Calls the AddClientMenu() function to add a new client.
 * 4. Edit - Calls the EditClientMenu() function to edit an existing client.
 * 5. Back - Exits the client menu and returns to the previous menu.
 *
 * The function uses a loop to repeatedly display the menu and process user input until the user
 * chooses the "Back" option.
